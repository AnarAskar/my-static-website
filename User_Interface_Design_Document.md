# User Interface Design Document

## Layout Structure
- A grid-based layout with a fixed navigation bar at the top.
- The homepage features a hero section with a professional photo and a tagline.
- Sections include About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact, arranged in a visually balanced grid.

## Core Components
- **Navigation Bar**: Fixed at the top with links to each section (About Me, Skills, Projects, Contact).
- **Hero Section**: A professional photo, a tagline, and a call-to-action button (e.g., "View My Work").
- **Projects Section**: A grid of cards with project thumbnails, titles, and short descriptions. Each card links to a detailed view or live demo.
- **Skills Section**: A horizontal scrolling list of skill badges with tooltips for details.
- **Contact Section**: A simple form or clickable icons for email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

## Interaction Patterns
- Smooth scrolling between sections when navigation links are clicked.
- Hover effects on project cards to highlight interactivity.
- Sticky navigation bar that remains visible as the user scrolls.

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme
- **Color Palette**: Navy blue, white, and light gray for a clean and professional look.
- **Gradients and Shadows**: Subtle gradients and shadows to add depth and polish.
- **Icons**: Minimalist icons for skills and contact links.

## Mobile, Web App, Desktop Considerations
- **Mobile**: The grid layout adapts to a single-column view. The navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu.
- **Tablet**: Two-column layout for sections like Projects and Skills.
- **Desktop**: Full grid layout with ample spacing and alignment.

## Typography
- **Font Family**: Sans-serif fonts like Roboto or Open Sans for readability.
- **Font Sizes**: Larger headings for section titles, medium-sized text for descriptions, and smaller text for tooltips.

## Accessibility
- High contrast for text to ensure readability.
- Alt text for all images and icons.
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements.
- ARIA roles for navigation and form elements to ensure screen reader compatibility.
